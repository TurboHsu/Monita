### Monita, Monitor every server, in a better way.

Monita is a server monitor which can monitor cpu usage, mem usage, etc.
Unlike ServerStatus, Monita will keep the received data and draw them in a chart.

Monita uses AES256 to encrypt data transfered.

Already completed:
    C/S Encryprted handshake.
    Client side data collection&Send.

Todo:
    Server side data processing.
    A web user interface(which will use chart.js) ~~This must be the most important thing...~~
    Add more...

Maybe todo:
    Customize data received.
    Make server & client in one program.~~?~~
